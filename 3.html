    <li>Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.
    <li>Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.
    <li>Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents.
    <li>With HTML, authors describe the structure of pages using markup. The elements of the language label pieces of content such as “paragraph,” “list,” “table,” and so on.
